# Specification Quality Checklist: VTea UI Makeover

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes:**
- Spec focuses on WHAT (visual hierarchy, behaviors) not HOW (specific frameworks or code)
- All sections target user experience outcomes (readability, accessibility, performance)
- Technical Details section intentionally omitted as this is a UI refresh (no data model changes)

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes:**
- All 8 user stories have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include specific metrics (≥90 Lighthouse score, ≤2 seconds load time, ≥44px touch targets)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can start session in ≤2 interactions") not technical implementation
- Open Questions section addresses 7 potential edge cases with default resolutions
- Out of Scope section explicitly defers 15+ features to future phases
- 10 assumptions documented covering browser support, performance, and scope boundaries

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes:**
- 8 user stories cover: first-time experience, visual hierarchy, mode switching, mobile responsiveness, task drawer, settings, keyboard nav, screen reader support
- 35+ acceptance criteria across all stories
- Success criteria section includes 4 categories: UX metrics, Performance metrics, Accessibility metrics, Responsiveness metrics
- Design & UX section describes WHAT users see and experience, not HOW it's coded

---

## Validation Summary

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Overall Assessment:**
- All checklist items pass
- Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic
- Clear boundaries between in-scope and out-of-scope features
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No ambiguous requirements or unresolved clarifications

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional - no critical gaps identified)
2. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan

## Detailed Validation Notes

### Content Quality ✅
- **No implementation details:** Spec describes visual hierarchy, contrast ratios, touch target sizes—all measurable design outcomes, not code
- **User-focused:** Every section answers "what does the user see/experience?" not "how is it built?"
- **Non-technical language:** Terms like "immersive background," "segmented control," "auto-hide" are design patterns, not technical jargon
- **Complete sections:** Overview, User Stories, Constitutional Compliance, Design & UX, Testing, Rollout, Metrics, Questions, Assumptions, Out of Scope

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **Testable requirements:** Examples:
  - "Full-bleed background displays immediately on page load" → verifiable via visual test
  - "Timer font ≥90px on mobile, ≥120px on desktop" → measurable via DevTools
  - "All interactive elements ≥44×44px" → automated accessibility audit
- **Measurable success criteria:** 
  - "Lighthouse Performance ≥90" → objective metric
  - "Users start session in ≤2 interactions" → user testing count
  - "Zero WCAG AA violations" → automated scan result
- **Technology-agnostic criteria:** No mention of React, Redux, CSS-in-JS, or specific libraries
- **Edge cases covered:** Open Questions addresses slow connections, mobile editing, 50+ tasks, fullscreen API denial

### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Comprehensive acceptance criteria:** 
  - Story 1 (Immersive Experience): 6 criteria
  - Story 2 (Visual Hierarchy): 6 criteria
  - Story 3 (Mode Switcher): 6 criteria
  - Story 4 (Mobile): 7 criteria
  - Story 5 (Task Drawer): 7 criteria
  - Story 6 (Settings): 6 criteria
  - Story 7 (Keyboard Nav): 6 criteria
  - Story 8 (Screen Reader): 6 criteria
- **Primary flows defined:** First-time visit → session start → drawer auto-hide → settings adjust → keyboard navigation → screen reader flow
- **Implementation-free:** Design patterns described (segmented control, bottom sheet, side panel) without specifying CSS Grid vs. Flexbox, React vs. vanilla JS, etc.
