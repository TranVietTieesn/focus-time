# Specification Quality Checklist: Action Controls Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes:**
- Spec focuses on WHAT users can do (restart sessions, enter fullscreen) not HOW to implement
- References Fullscreen API by name (acceptable for validation, not implementation direction)
- All sections address user outcomes and business goals
- Constitutional compliance section completed with justification

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes:**
- All 4 user stories have specific, testable acceptance criteria (6 criteria per story)
- Success criteria include measurable outcomes: "≤1 interaction", "≥44×44px", "≥90% browser compatibility"
- Success criteria focus on user experience, not technical implementation
- Open Questions section addresses 4 edge cases with default resolutions
- Out of Scope section defers 7+ features to future work
- 8 assumptions documented covering behavior, persistence, and accessibility

---

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes:**
- 4 user stories cover: restart flow, fullscreen flow, visual affordances, keyboard navigation
- 24 acceptance criteria across all stories (6 per story)
- Success criteria section includes 7 measurable outcomes covering UX, accessibility, and compatibility
- Design & UX section describes WHAT users see and experience, minimal HOW
- Testing Strategy lists verification methods without specifying test framework

---

## Validation Summary

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Overall Assessment:**
- All checklist items pass
- Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic
- Clear boundaries between in-scope and out-of-scope features
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No ambiguous requirements or unresolved clarifications

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` (no clarifications needed)
2. Implementation can begin immediately after plan approval

## Detailed Validation Notes

### Content Quality ✅
- **No implementation details:** Spec describes user actions (click restart, enter fullscreen) not React components or state management
- **User-focused:** Every section answers "what does the user experience?" not "how is it coded?"
- **Non-technical language:** Terms like "restart button," "fullscreen mode," "keyboard shortcuts" are user-facing, not developer jargon
- **Complete sections:** Overview, User Stories (4), Constitutional Compliance, Design & UX, Testing, Rollout, Metrics, Questions, Assumptions, Out of Scope

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **Testable requirements:** Examples:
  - "Restart button has ≥44×44px touch target" → measurable via DevTools
  - "Fullscreen mode hides browser UI" → verifiable via manual test
  - "R key restarts timer" → automated test scenario
- **Measurable success criteria:** 
  - "Users can restart in ≤1 interaction" → interaction count
  - "≥44×44px touch targets" → pixel measurement
  - "≥90% browser compatibility" → compatibility matrix
- **Technology-agnostic criteria:** Focus on outcomes ("users can restart") not implementation ("RestartButton component renders")
- **Edge cases covered:** Open Questions addresses confirmation modals, auto-fullscreen, iOS limitations, persistence

### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Comprehensive acceptance criteria:** 
  - Story 1 (Restart): 6 criteria covering visibility, behavior, confirmation, accessibility, keyboard
  - Story 2 (Fullscreen): 7 criteria covering API, state, persistence, fallback, accessibility
  - Story 3 (Visual Affordances): 6 criteria covering indicators, icons, tooltips, hierarchy
  - Story 4 (Keyboard): 6 criteria covering navigation, shortcuts, screen readers, focus
- **Primary flows defined:** Restart flow → Fullscreen flow → Keyboard navigation → Visual discovery
- **Implementation-free:** Design patterns described (circular arrow icon, expand icon) without specifying SVG paths, CSS classes, React props
