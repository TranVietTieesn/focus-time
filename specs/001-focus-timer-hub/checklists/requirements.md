# Specification Quality Checklist: Focus Timer Hub MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec focuses on "what" not "how"; technical details section describes interfaces and data models technology-agnostically
  
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status:** PASS - All user stories clearly articulate user goals and benefits; success criteria measure user outcomes
  
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status:** PASS - Overview and user stories are accessible; technical details are clearly separated
  
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status:** PASS - Overview, User Stories, Constitutional Compliance, Design & UX, Technical Details, Testing, Rollout, Metrics, Open Questions all present

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status:** PASS - No clarification markers present; all decisions made with documented assumptions
  
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status:** PASS - All acceptance criteria are specific and verifiable (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "minimum 44x44px")
  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status:** PASS - All success criteria include specific metrics (95% completion rate, 5 seconds, 70% completion, etc.)
  
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status:** PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes (time to complete, completion rate, return rate) not technical metrics
  
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status:** PASS - Five user stories with detailed acceptance criteria covering timer, tasks, tracking, mobile, and customization
  
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Open Questions section addresses: background timer behavior, mid-session closure, auto-transitions, break timing
  
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status:** PASS - MVP scope explicitly defined; out-of-scope items clearly documented (cloud sync, gamification, etc.)
  
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Assumptions section documents 7 key assumptions; dependencies listed in Technical Details

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Each user story includes 4-6 specific, testable acceptance criteria
  
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status:** PASS - Five user stories cover: quick start, task management, progress tracking, mobile experience, customization
  
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - 10 measurable success criteria defined with specific targets
  
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout; technical section describes contracts not implementations

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Total Checks:** 16  
**Passed:** 16  
**Failed:** 0  

---

## Notes

- **Strengths:**
  - Comprehensive user stories with clear acceptance criteria
  - Well-defined success criteria with specific metrics
  - Strong constitutional compliance alignment
  - Clear scope boundaries (MVP vs. future features)
  - Thoughtful assumptions documented

- **Observations:**
  - Open Questions section handles ambiguities with documented default decisions
  - Rollout plan provides clear phased approach
  - Accessibility considerations well-integrated throughout

- **Recommendations:**
  - Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
  - No further clarifications needed before planning
  - Consider running `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan

---

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Specification validated and approved
2. → Run `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan
3. → Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate task breakdown
