## Design & UX

### User Interface

**Primary Views:**

1. **Timer View (Default Screen)**
   - Large countdown timer display (MM:SS format)
   - Current session type indicator (Work / Short Break / Long Break)
   - Primary action button: Start / Pause / Resume
   - Optional: Current task name displayed above timer
   - Session counter (e.g., "Session 2 of 4")
   - Quick access to task selection

2. **Task List View**
   - Simple list of active tasks
   - Each task shows: title, estimated sessions, completion status
   - Quick actions: add new task, edit task, mark complete, delete
   - Visual indicator for "current task" associated with timer
   - Option to start focus session from any task

3. **Daily Stats View**
   - Today's total focused time (hours and minutes)
   - Number of completed sessions today
   - Simple progress visualization (optional: progress bar or session dots)
   - Minimal design: focus on the numbers, not distracting graphs

### Interactions

- **Starting a session:** Single tap/click on "Start" button
- **Pausing:** Single tap/click on "Pause" button (timer stops, can be resumed)
- **Completing early:** Optional "Complete" button to end session before timer expires
- **Break transitions:** After work session ends, break timer auto-starts (or requires one confirmation tap)
- **Task selection:** Tap task name to associate it with next focus session
- **Task creation:** Simple inline form or modal: enter task name, optional session estimate, save

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Color contrast verified:** All text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Keyboard navigation:** Full keyboard support for timer controls, task management, and view switching
- **Screen reader support:** Proper ARIA labels for timer status, buttons, and task states
- **Mobile responsive:** Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px), readable font sizes (minimum 16px body text)
- **Focus indicators:** Clear visual focus states for all interactive elements

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Client-Side Only (Offline-First):**
- Single-page application (SPA) architecture
- All logic runs in the browser
- Local storage for persistence (localStorage for settings, IndexedDB for session history)
- No backend required for MVP

**Key Components:**
1. **Timer Engine:** Manages countdown logic, state transitions (work → break → work)
2. **Task Manager:** CRUD operations for tasks, local persistence
3. **Session Tracker:** Records completed sessions, calculates daily totals
4. **Settings Manager:** Stores user preferences for durations

### Data Model

**Task Entity:**
```
Task {
  id: UUID (unique identifier)
  title: string (required, max 200 chars)
  estimatedSessions: number (optional, default null)
  isCompleted: boolean (default false)
  createdAt: timestamp
  completedAt: timestamp (nullable)
}
```

**FocusSession Entity:**
```
FocusSession {
  id: UUID
  taskId: UUID (nullable, reference to Task)
  type: "work" | "shortBreak" | "longBreak"
  duration: number (minutes)
  startedAt: timestamp
  completedAt: timestamp
  wasCompleted: boolean (true if user finished full duration)
}
```

**UserSettings Entity:**
```
UserSettings {
  workDuration: number (minutes, default 25)
  shortBreakDuration: number (minutes, default 5)
  longBreakDuration: number (minutes, default 15)
  sessionsBeforeLongBreak: number (default 4)
}
```

### APIs / Interfaces

**Timer Interface:**
```
Timer {
  start(sessionType, duration): void
  pause(): void
  resume(): void
  complete(): void
  getCurrentTime(): number (seconds remaining)
  getStatus(): "idle" | "running" | "paused" | "completed"
}
```

**Task Manager Interface:**
```
TaskManager {
  createTask(title, estimatedSessions?): Task
  updateTask(taskId, updates): Task
  deleteTask(taskId): void
  completeTask(taskId): Task
  getTasks(): Task[]
  getActiveTask(): Task | null
}
```

**Session Tracker Interface:**
```
SessionTracker {
  recordSession(session): void
  getDailyTotal(date): number (minutes)
  getDailySessions(date): FocusSession[]
}
```

### Dependencies

- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- localStorage API (for settings and tasks)
- IndexedDB API (for session history)
- Web Notifications API (optional, for session completion alerts)
- Service Worker (optional, for offline PWA capability)

### Performance Targets

- **Initial page load time:** <2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Timer update frequency:** 1 second intervals (visual countdown)
- **Memory usage:** <50 MB for typical daily usage (browser memory)
- **Offline support:** Yes (100% of core features work offline via PWA)
- **Battery efficiency:** Minimal CPU usage when timer is running

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** >80% coverage for timer logic, task CRUD operations, session tracking calculations
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** 
  - Full user flow: create task → start session → complete → verify daily total updates
  - Timer state transitions: start → pause → resume → complete
  - Data persistence: settings and tasks survive page reload
- [ ] **Accessibility Tests:** 
  - Automated WCAG AA verification (e.g., axe-core)
  - Manual keyboard navigation testing
  - Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] **Mobile Testing:**
  - Touch interaction testing on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome)
  - Responsive layout verification at common breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px)
  - Offline functionality testing (airplane mode)
  - Background timer behavior testing

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Core Timer & Task Management (Week 1-2)
- Implement timer engine (start, pause, resume, complete)
- Default Pomodoro durations (25/5/15)
- Basic task CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Local storage for tasks and settings
- Responsive UI for timer and task list

**Success Checkpoint:** User can create tasks and complete at least one full Pomodoro session

### Phase 2: Session Tracking & Daily Stats (Week 3)
- Session history persistence (IndexedDB)
- Daily total calculation and display
- Session counter and progress tracking
- Custom duration settings

**Success Checkpoint:** User can view daily focus progress and customize durations

### Phase 3: UX Polish & Accessibility (Week 4)
- Accessibility audit and fixes (WCAG AA compliance)
- Mobile optimization (touch targets, font scaling)
- Keyboard navigation improvements
- Notification system for session completion
- Offline PWA setup (service worker, web manifest)

**Success Checkpoint:** Website passes accessibility audit and works fully offline as PWA

### Rollback Plan
- **Local storage issues:** Provide reset function to clear corrupted data
- **Timer bugs:** Feature flag to disable problematic features, fallback to basic countdown
- **Performance issues:** Reduce timer update frequency, simplify animations
- **Critical failures:** Maintain simple HTML/JS fallback version with basic timer only

## Open Questions / Risks

| Question | Impact | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Should the website auto-transition from work to break, or require user confirmation? | Medium | Auto-transition reduces friction but may surprise users; user confirmation adds one interaction but gives control. **Default: Auto-start break timer with dismissible notification** |
| How should we handle timer behavior when browser tab is backgrounded on mobile? | High | Browser background tab throttling may affect timer accuracy; may need service worker or notification-based timer. **Assumption: Use service worker for background accuracy** |
| Should long break trigger automatically after 4 sessions, or let user choose? | Low | Auto-trigger reinforces Pomodoro method; manual choice gives flexibility. **Default: Auto-trigger after 4 sessions with option to skip** |
| What happens if user closes browser tab mid-session? | Medium | Options: (1) discard session, (2) save as incomplete, (3) prompt to resume. **Default: Save as incomplete, offer resume on next visit** |

---

## Assumptions

1. **No user accounts:** All data is device-local; users understand data doesn't sync across devices
2. **Modern browser support:** Targeting browsers with ES6+ and localStorage/IndexedDB support (Chrome 60+, Safari 12+, Firefox 60+)
3. **Notification permissions:** Users may decline notification permissions; app must function fully without them
4. **Single device usage:** MVP assumes single-user, single-device usage; multi-device sync is out of scope
5. **No historical analytics:** Daily stats reset each day; no week/month views in MVP
6. **English language only:** Internationalization deferred to future phases
7. **No sound effects:** Session completion alerts are visual/notification-based; audio cues deferred to future phases
