## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Timer Engine
- **Tick Rate:** 1 second visual updates
- **Accuracy:** Wall-clock delta prevents drift in background tabs
- **State:** Idle → Running → Paused → Complete
- **Persistence:** Snapshots saved on pause for crash recovery

### State Management
```typescript
{
  timer: { status, type, remainingSec, ... },
  tasks: { tasks[], activeTaskId },
  settings: { workMin, shortBreakMin, longBreakMin, theme, ... },
  stats: { todayDate, todayTotalMin, todaySessionsCount }
}
```

### localStorage Schema
- `FT_SETTINGS_v1` - User preferences
- `FT_TASKS_v1` - Task list
- `FT_TODAY_v1` - Daily statistics
- `FT_SESSIONS_LATEST_v1` - Session snapshot

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No offline PWA** - Service worker registered but caching not fully configured
2. **No notifications** - Toast system ready but not integrated with timer events
3. **No unit tests** - Test files scaffolded but not written
4. **No E2E tests** - Playwright configured but tests not written
5. **Theme toggle UI only** - Light/dark themes need CSS implementation
6. **No auto-start breaks** - Prompt shown but requires manual action

---

## 📚 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Priority 1: Polish & UX
1. Implement toast notifications for session completion
2. Add subtle sound/vibration on completion
3. Implement light/dark theme CSS
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Space = start/pause, Esc = cancel)
5. Improve loading states and transitions

### Priority 2: Testing
1. Write unit tests for all store slices
2. Write integration tests for key user flows
3. Write E2E tests with Playwright
4. Add visual regression tests

### Priority 3: PWA & Mobile
1. Configure Workbox caching strategies
2. Add install prompt
3. Optimize for mobile performance
4. Add touch gestures
5. Test on real devices

### Priority 4: Features
1. Weekly/monthly stats view
2. Task completion notifications
3. Custom background scenes
4. Ambient soundscapes
5. Export/import data
6. Keyboard shortcuts guide
