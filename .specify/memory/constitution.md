# Project Constitution: Focus Timer Hub

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Last Amended Date:** 2025-10-27

---

## Executive Summary

Focus Timer Hub is a productivity-first timer application that prioritizes user focus, accessibility, and trust. This constitution enshrines six core principles that guide all architectural, design, and development decisions.

---

## Principle 1: Focus-first Experience

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- The product MUST reduce distractions and encourage deep focus.
- The timer MUST be usable with minimal interaction (single tap start).
- The UI MUST avoid intrusive notifications, ads, or unnecessary pop-ups.

**Rationale:** Users select this tool to increase productivity and minimize cognitive load. Any feature or interaction that pulls attention away from focused work undermines the core value proposition.

---

## Principle 2: Simple and Consistent UI

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- A unified design system MUST be followed for visual and interaction consistency.
- All components MUST adhere to defined design tokens and usage guidelines.
- Text labels MUST be short, direct, and non-ambiguous.

**Rationale:** Consistency builds trust, clarity, and usability under focus conditions. When users are deep in focus, they should not need to relearn patterns or decipher unclear labels.

---

## Principle 3: Accessibility and Mobile-first

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- The interface MUST support keyboard navigation.
- Color contrast MUST comply with WCAG AA at minimum.
- Features MUST perform equally well on mobile and desktop.

**Rationale:** Focus tools MUST support everyone and work no matter the context. Accessibility is not optional—it is a core requirement for an inclusive productivity app.

---

## Principle 4: Lightweight Performance

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- The application MUST load quickly under weak network conditions.
- Offline-first behavior SHOULD be prioritized using local storage.
- Animations MUST remain subtle to avoid performance overhead.

**Rationale:** Users expect instant access when transitioning into focus sessions. Slow load times or janky animations disrupt the focus experience and waste precious productive time.

---

## Principle 5: Clear and Maintainable Development Workflow

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- Changes MUST follow Spec Driven Development using Spec Kit commands.
- No new feature SHALL be developed without updating specifications first.
- Code readability and scalability MUST guide architectural decisions.

**Rationale:** Ensures sustainable growth while minimizing rework. A clear development process allows the team to move confidently and prevents technical debt from eroding the product.

---

## Principle 6: Local-first Secure Data Handling

**Non-negotiable Requirements:**
- Personal data MUST NOT be transmitted without explicit user consent.
- MVP phase MUST rely on local persistence over cloud storage.
- Privacy MUST be communicated transparently within the UX.

**Rationale:** Privacy fosters user trust, especially for productivity apps. Collecting or sharing focus data without clear consent violates the trust relationship with users.

---

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
1. **Proposal:** Any team member may propose a constitution amendment via pull request.
2. **Rationale:** The proposal MUST include explicit reasoning for the change (principle added, removed, redefined, or governance update).
3. **Review:** All maintainers MUST review and approve amendments.
4. **Ratification:** Approved amendments are merged and dated.

### Versioning Policy
Constitution versions follow Semantic Versioning:
- **MAJOR:** Backward-incompatible principle removals or fundamental redefinitions.
- **MINOR:** New principles or materially expanded principle guidance.
- **PATCH:** Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements, or governance process updates.

### Compliance Review
- **Quarterly:** Team SHOULD review constitution alignment with current product direction.
- **Per-Release:** Before major releases, verify all features and decisions align with principles.
- **Per-Spec:** When creating or amending specifications, cross-reference affected principles.

### Dependent Template Sync
When constitution changes are ratified:
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` — principles guide planning scope
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` — spec sections align with principle concerns
- `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` — task categorization reflects principle-driven priorities
- `.specify/commands/*.md` — all command guidance remains current with constitutional intent
