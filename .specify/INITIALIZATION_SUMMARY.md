# Focus Timer Hub â€” Spec Kit Initialization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Action:** Project constitution created and Spec Kit templates initialized  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Project Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Ratified

The project constitution establishes six core principles:

1. **Focus-first Experience** â€” Minimal interaction, no distractions
2. **Simple and Consistent UI** â€” Unified design system, clear labels
3. **Accessibility and Mobile-first** â€” WCAG AA, keyboard navigation, responsive
4. **Lightweight Performance** â€” Fast loading, offline-first, subtle animations
5. **Clear and Maintainable Development Workflow** â€” Spec Driven Development
6. **Local-first Secure Data Handling** â€” User data stored locally, privacy-first

**Key Governance Rules:**
- All features MUST align with these principles before approval
- Constitution amendments use semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)
- Quarterly compliance reviews required
- All specification documents must cross-reference applicable principles

---

### 2. Spec Kit Templates

#### `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`
**Purpose:** Feature planning template aligned with constitutional principles

**Key Sections:**
- Objective definition
- Constitutional alignment checklist (6 principles)
- Scope (in/out)
- Milestones and success metrics
- Dependencies and risk assessment

**Usage:** `/speckit.plan` command fills this template

---

#### `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
**Purpose:** Feature specification template enforcing compliance

**Key Sections:**
- Overview and user stories
- **Constitutional Compliance Check** (mandatory gate before approval)
- Design & UX with accessibility considerations
- Technical details and performance targets
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, accessibility, mobile)
- Rollout and metrics

**Usage:** `/speckit.spec` command fills this template

---

#### `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`
**Purpose:** Task breakdown organized by constitutional principles

**Key Sections:**
- **Phase 1:** Design & Research (principle-driven tasks)
  - Focus-first Experience verification
  - Design System & UI consistency
  - Accessibility audit
  - Performance baseline
  - Privacy & data handling plan
  
- **Phase 2:** Implementation (core, backend, frontend)
- **Phase 3:** Testing & Validation (unit, integration, accessibility, mobile, performance)
- **Phase 4:** Documentation & Deployment
- Quality gates between phases
- Progress tracking

**Usage:** `/speckit.tasks` command fills this template

---

### 3. Project Documentation

#### `README.md`
Comprehensive project guide including:
- Project vision and core commitments
- Quick start instructions
- Project structure explanation
- Contributing guidelines (must align with constitution)
- Architecture overview
- Design principles in action (example: adding new timer option)
- FAQ
- Support and resources

## How to Use Going Forward

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Plan Phase**
   ```bash
   # Use plan-template.md to outline feature
   # Check ALL 6 principles for applicability
   # Define milestones and success metrics
   ```

2. **Specification Phase**
   ```bash
   # Use spec-template.md to define requirements
   # MANDATORY: Complete Constitutional Compliance Check
   # All 6 principles must be checked (âœ… Compliant or explanation)
   # Feature cannot proceed without compliance approval
   ```

3. **Task Breakdown Phase**
   ```bash
   # Use tasks-template.md for implementation work
   # Include principle-driven design tasks in Phase 1
   # Every phase has quality gates
   # Tasks reflect constitutional priorities
   ```

4. **Implementation Phase**
   ```bash
   # Build according to specification
   # Follow design system and code patterns
   # Verify accessibility throughout
   # Maintain performance targets
   ```

5. **Amending the Constitution** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Use speckit.constitution command
   # Proposal must include explicit reasoning
   # All maintainers must review and approve
   # Version number updates automatically based on change type
   ```

## Key Principles in Development

### Principle 1: Focus-first Experience
When developing, ask:
- Can users accomplish the goal with minimal interaction?
- Are there any notifications, pop-ups, or distracting elements?
- Is the focus path clear and uncluttered?

### Principle 2: Simple and Consistent UI
When designing, ask:
- Does this use existing design tokens?
- Are labels short, clear, and non-ambiguous?
- Does this follow established patterns?

### Principle 3: Accessibility and Mobile-first
Before approval, verify:
- Keyboard navigation works throughout
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- Mobile and desktop experiences are equal

### Principle 4: Lightweight Performance
Performance checklist:
- Load time target: <2 seconds on 3G
- Time to interactive: <1 second
- Memory usage: <10MB
- Offline functionality: Fully supported

### Principle 5: Clear and Maintainable Development Workflow
Development standards:
- All features specified before coding
- Code is readable and well-structured
- Architecture supports scaling

### Principle 6: Local-first Secure Data Handling
Data handling checklist:
- User data stored locally by default
- Any transmission requires explicit consent
- Privacy clearly communicated in UX

## Next Steps

1. **Review the Constitution** â€” Read [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](memory/constitution.md) thoroughly
2. **Familiarize with Templates** â€” Review all three templates to understand structure
3. **Read Contributing Guide** â€” Check README.md Contributing section
4. **Plan First Feature** â€” Use plan-template.md for first initiative
5. **Specify Feature** â€” Use spec-template.md with mandatory compliance check
