# 🚀 Focus Timer Hub — Quick Start Guide

**Welcome!** You're about to build an amazing productivity tool guided by clear principles.

---

## 📋 The 30-Second Overview

Focus Timer Hub is governed by **6 constitutional principles**. Every feature MUST align with these principles before it's approved.

**The Principles:**
1. 🎯 **Focus-first** — Minimal interaction, no distractions
2. 🎨 **Simple & Consistent UI** — Design tokens, clear labels
3. ♿ **Accessibility & Mobile** — WCAG AA, keyboard nav
4. ⚡ **Lightweight Performance** — Fast, offline-capable
5. 📐 **Clear Development** — Spec-first, documented
6. 🔒 **Local-first Privacy** — User data stored locally

## 🛠️ Building Your First Feature

Follow this 5-step workflow:

### Step 1: Plan
```bash
# Edit: .specify/templates/plan-template.md
# ✓ Write your feature objective
# ✓ Check all 6 principles (which apply to YOU?)
# ✓ Define success metrics
```

### Step 2: Specify (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE CHECK!)
```bash
# Edit: .specify/templates/spec-template.md
# ✓ Write user stories
# ✓ Complete the "Constitutional Compliance Check" section
#   (This is a MANDATORY gate—all 6 principles must be checked)
# ✓ Define technical requirements
# ✓ Plan testing strategy
```

### Step 3: Create Tasks
```bash
# Edit: .specify/templates/tasks-template.md
# ✓ Phase 1: Design & Research
# ✓ Phase 2: Implementation
# ✓ Phase 3: Testing & Validation
# ✓ Phase 4: Documentation & Deploy
# ✓ Include quality gates between phases
```

### Step 4: Implement
```bash
# Code according to your specification
# ✓ Follow design system
# ✓ Verify accessibility
# ✓ Meet performance targets
# ✓ Write tests (>80% coverage)
```

### Step 5: Review & Ship
```bash
# Code review + compliance check
# ✓ Verify spec alignment
# ✓ Check principle compliance
# ✓ Accessibility verification
# ✓ Performance measurement
# Then deploy with confidence!
```

## 🎯 The Mandatory Compliance Check

**CRITICAL:** Every feature specification MUST include a "Constitutional Compliance Check" section that verifies alignment with all 6 principles.

Example from spec-template.md:
```markdown
- [ ] **Principle 1: Focus-first Experience**
  - Is this accessible via minimal interaction?
  - Does it avoid intrusive notifications?
  - [ ] Compliant
  
- [ ] **Principle 2: Simple and Consistent UI**
  - Does it follow design tokens?
  - Are labels short and clear?
  - [ ] Compliant

- [ ] **Principle 3: Accessibility and Mobile-first**
  - Keyboard navigation working?
  - WCAG AA color contrast verified?
  - [ ] Compliant
  
[... Principles 4, 5, 6 follow same pattern ...]
```

**Feature cannot proceed without ALL principles marked "Compliant".**

## ❓ Quick Q&A

### Q: Where do I start?
**A:** Read the constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`), then pick a feature to build.

### Q: Why 6 principles?
**A:** They reflect the core commitments to users and team. Every decision flows from these principles.

### Q: Can I skip the compliance check?
**A:** No! The Constitutional Compliance Check is a mandatory gate. Every spec MUST verify all 6 principles.

### Q: What if my feature doesn't align with a principle?
**A:** Redesign the feature to comply. If a principle genuinely blocks you, propose a constitution amendment (rare!).

### Q: How do I amend the constitution?
**A:** Use `.specify/commands/speckit.constitution.md`. Requires explicit reasoning and all maintainer approval.

### Q: Is this too much process?
**A:** It seems like more upfront, but it prevents rework, keeps the team aligned, and ensures we don't drift from our core commitments.
